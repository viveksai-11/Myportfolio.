     <h1>Introduction</h1>
     <p>I'm VK, a passionate and creative web developer with a strong foundation in crafting dynamic and innovative digital experiences. With a keen eye for detail and a commitment to excellence, I specialize in turning ideas into responsive and user-friendly websites.
     I am a Front-end Developer with 8+ years commercial experience.

     I work to make a better web; one that is fast, easy to use, beautiful, accessible to all, and frustration-free. Regardless of your specific business requirements, in solving these challenges, you have a great chance of finding success online

     <p>My main experience is in front-end development but I also have a passion for design. Given that producing a modern website requires the combination of design, server technology, and the layer that users interacts with, I believe having experience in both design and development allows for making the most optimal user experiences.</body>
     </p>My clients have found that hiring me has saved them time and money, made it easier to grow their website alongside their business, and made for a product that is consistently of high quality.
     </p>
     Building a future-proof and easy-to-maintain website is achieved by breaking down a web page into its smallest pieces, often called components, and building them in a way that exists outside the context of the design they first appear in. This allows for components that can be re-used in other areas of a website as it grows and makes the intention easier for other developers to understand and test. Wherever possible, I find it valuable to create a style guide (using Storybook for example) that acts as a document for a reusable and maintainable code base. All involved in a project can rely on a style guide to understand a project’s language and produce a more consistent user experience. Re-usable components make for a website that can quickly grow as does your business.
     </p><p>I have a special interest in use of animation on the web. I particularly like working on websites that have seamless transitions and require high-level performance to maintain a smooth and appealing website.
